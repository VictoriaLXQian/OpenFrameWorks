# Project Proposal

## PROJECT 1: Narrative

### This project intends to portray a narrative about journey. It tells a story of traveling, relocating and memories fading away. 

* The Target User: ALL people.
* User Experience: LOW level of interaction; the experience is like watching an animated illustration story. 
* Succeful Translation: Cohesive visual design; design and color

#### Example Scenes:

* Scene 1: Seeing a person running through the train window; will include movement, the window and the person will move with a different speed. <This is the starting scene of the narrative.>
* Scene 2: One of the landscape of the journey; might include minor level of movement/ interaction
* Scene 3: A close-up scene; will include movement

## PROJECT 3: Game 

### Idea #1: This is a game designed to learn the basic characters/caligraphy for a language through musical sound. In another way, it can also train the user's absolute pitch by playing the game. Sound of different musical instruments will be differentiated by the color/shape of the design elements. Colors having the same level of lightness will sugget a successful completion of find the character, which will lead to a same-tune scale by different instruments and the direction of the shapes will indicate how to write. 

* The Target User: ALL people, especially for new language learners, people want to train their absolute pitch.
* User Experience: MEDIUM level of interaction; This is an experience highly dependent on sound and color. 
* Succeful Translation: Cohesive visual design; design and color; sound
